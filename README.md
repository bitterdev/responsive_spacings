# Responsive Spacings 

Who hasn't faced the problem? You set padding or margin values for areas or blocks, and while everything looks fine on desktop, those same values are way too large on mobile or tablets. What if there was an add-on that scales your spacing values responsively—automatically adjusting them across all screen sizes?

That’s exactly what this add-on does.

With Responsive Spacings for Concrete CMS, you can apply utility CSS classes with values up to 100rem in any direction—top, bottom, left, right, or combinations. And best of all: these spacings scale responsively depending on the screen size. Clean, consistent spacing. No more bloated mobile layouts.
